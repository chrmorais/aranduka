Aranduka is still not ready for everyday use.

However, here are some of the features already in place and maybe/kinda working.

  * Access millions of free books via several sources.
  * Catalog and organize your books
  * Read RSS feeds as books
  * Import your current eBook collection (work in progress)
  * Automatically "guesses" data about your book. If you have the title, it will get author, ISBN and cover, for example.
  * Read ePub and Comic Book internally. Open external viewers for other formats
  * Import your physical books using your webcam as a barcode scanner.

We want testers and we want help, feel free to contact us in our discussion group.
